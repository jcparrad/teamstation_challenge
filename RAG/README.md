# Setting up the retrieval system

I use a modular system with these components:
1. search
2. reranking modules

## Indexing
I used lamaindex for the indexing part.  The indexing notebook is [here](1_rag_indexing.ipynb). The index is persisted in the folder persist

## Retrieval

the notebook for setting and experimenting the with retrieval module is [here](2_rag_retrieving_with_reranker.ipynb)
